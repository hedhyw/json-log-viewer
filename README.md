It is an **interactive** tool for viewing and analyzing complex structured [json-log](assets/example.log) files.

Main features:
1. It is interactive.
2. It displays a compact list of log entries.
3. It is possible to expand the log and see the full prettified JSON tree.
4. All non-json logs are captured.
5. It understands different field names: `time`, `timestamp`, `msg`, `message`, `err`, `error` etc.
6. It supports case-insensitive filtering.
7. Colorized log levels.

It uses [antonmedv/fx](https://github.com/antonmedv/fx) for viewing JSON records and [charmbracelet/bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for organizing the terminal UI. The tool is inspired by the project [json-log-viewer](https://github.com/gistia/json-log-viewer) which is unfortunately outdated and deserted.

The application is designed to help in visualization, navigation, and analyzing of JSON-formatted log data in a user-friendly and interactive manner. It provides a structured and organized view of the JSON logs, making it easier to comprehend the hierarchical nature of the data. It uses collapsible/expandable tree structures, indentation, and color-coded syntax to represent the JSON objects and arrays. It is possible to search for specific keywords, phrases, or patterns within the JSON logs. So it helps to significantly simplify the process of working with JSON logs, making it more intuitive and efficient. It is easy to troubleshoot issues, monitor system performance, or gain a deeper understanding of the application's behavior by analyzing its log data in post-mortem.

```

### Package

Latest DEB and RPM packages are available on [the releases page](https://github.com/hedhyw/json-log-viewer/releases/latest).

### Standalone Binary

Download latest archive `*.tar.gz` for your target platform from [the releases page](https://github.com/hedhyw/json-log-viewer/releases/latest) and extract it to `/usr/local/bin/jlv`. Add this path to `PATH` environment.

### Source

```sh

cd json-log-viewer
make build
cp ./bin/jlv /usr/local/bin
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jlv

# jlv application.log
```

## Customization

The application will look for the config `.jlv.jsonc` in the working directory or in the home directory:
- `$PWD/.jlv.jsonc`;
- `$HOME/.jlv.jsonc`.

The Json path supports the described in [yalp/jsonpath](https://github.com/yalp/jsonpath#jsonpath-quick-intro) syntax.

Example configuration:
```jsonc
{
    // Comments are allowed.
    "fields": [
        {
            "title": "Time", // Max length is 32.
            // Kind affects rendering. There are:
            // * time;
            // * level;
            // * message;
            // * any.
            "kind": "time",
            "ref": [
                // The application will display the first matched value.
                "$.timestamp",
                "$.time",
                "$.t",
                "$.ts"
            ],
            "width": 30
        },
        {
            "title": "Level",
            "kind": "level",
            "ref": [
                "$.level",
                "$.lvl",
                "$.l"
            ],
            "width": 10
        },
        {
            "title": "Message",
            "kind": "message",
            "ref": [
                "$.message",
                "$.msg",
                "$.error",
                "$.err"
            ],
            "width": 0 // The width will be calculated automatically.
        },
        {
            "title": "Custom",
            "kind": "any",
            "ref": [
                "$.custom"
            ],
            "width": 0
        }
    ]
}
```
